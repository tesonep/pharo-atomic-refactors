I represent a method name (selector and arguments) in the refactoring framework.

I am used by refactoring operations - for example RBMoveMethodRefactoring.

I have a selector name and a list of arguments and I use RBScanner to validate the syntax of my selector name.

In the refactory framework I am used for representing a new method name, generated by the refactoring operation or requested by the caller.

You can create instances of me by 
RBMethodName selector: 'color:' arguments:{'aColor'}.
(RBMethodName selector:'color' arguments:{}) isValid.
