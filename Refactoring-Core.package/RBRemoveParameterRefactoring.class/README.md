I am a refactoring for removing (unused) arguments.

My preconditions verify that the argument to be removed is not referenced by the methods and that the new method name isn't alread used.
Any sender of the prior selector will be changed to the new.

If the method contains more than one argument, I request the user to choose one of the arguments.
