I am a refactoring operation for renaming methods.

The new method name has to have the same number of arguments, but the order of arguments can be changed.

My preconditions verify that the number of arguments is the same and that the new method name isn't already used.

All references in senders of the old method are changed, either the method name only or the order of the supplied arguments.
