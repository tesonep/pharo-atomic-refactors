I am a refactoring for extracting code fragments to a new method. 

Similar to RBExtractMethodRefactoring, but you can choose to which component (instance or agument variable) the new method is added. 
As such, the new method arguments will include an additional argument for the sender.
Based on the instance variable you chosed for this method I will guess the class where to add this method, but you can change this class or add more classes.
