I am a refactoring for creating new classes. 

You can define the name, superclass, category and subclasses.

I am used by other refactorings that may create new classes, for example, RBSplitClassRefactoring.

My preconditions verify that I use a valid class name, that does not yet exists as a global variable, 
and the subclasses (if any) were direct subclasses of the superclass.
