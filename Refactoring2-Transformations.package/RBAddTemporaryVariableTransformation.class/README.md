I am responsible for adding a temporary variable inside a method. In Pharo, temporary variables can be declared inside blocks as well. By default, the container is the method itself.

Usage: 
transformation := (RBAddTemporaryVariableTransformation
			variable: #newVariable
			inMethod: #methodBefore
			inClass: #RBAddReturnStatementTransformationTest)
			transform.
(ChangesBrowser changes: transformation model changes changes) open

Observations about the transformation:
- In this implementation, the temporary variable will be added to the body of the method
