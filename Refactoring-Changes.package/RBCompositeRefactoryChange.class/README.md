I am a composition of RBRefactoryChanges. I hold a list of changes. 
I implement many "environment change" operation like renameClass/removeClass/ rename instance variable that are
actually called on the name space by a refactoring operation and my responsibilty is to create a appropriate refactoring change
and save it in my list of changes.
