I am a refactory change for a method change. I know a bout the 
source selector and protocol of the new or modified method. 

The controller instance variable is not directly use by me but needed for executing the change by compiling this
method, the controller is what we pass to the compiler, as the object to get notified by the compiler about the compilation result.
