I am the baseclass for a variable-name refactoring change. I know about the
class(name) for this variable renaming, whether it is on the instance or class side and the old and
new variable name. See my subclasses for the concrete implementation of renaming a class or an instance variable.

Executing this refactory change will change the variable name of the (global) class.
